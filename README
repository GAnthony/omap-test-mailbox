Simple loopback message test for mailbox.

**NOTE**  Kernel patch required due to mailbox API limitation

On OMAP3, only one mailbox is created with settings hard-coded for
MPU -> DSP messages.

The pach 'omap3-mailbox-loopack.patch' changes the hard-coded settings
so that the MPU is the receiver of the messages so a simple loopback
test can be done.

An API should be created to the message receiver can be configured at
runtime.
